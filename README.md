The task
----------
[Build a Simon Game](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game)

### Objective
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE)

### Rules
* Use whichever libraries or APIs you need

### User stories
* I am presented with a random series of button presses
* Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but
  with an additional step
* I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when
  I personally press a button
* If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts
  again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again
* I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses
* If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step
* I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and
  the game restarts at a new random series of button presses
* I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game
  starts over

### Hints
* Here are mp3s you can use for each button:
